# Plant_Leaf_Disease_Classification
### Objective
 Agriculture is one of the main factors that decide the growth of any country. In India it around 65% of the population is based on agriculture. Due to various seasonal conditions the crops get infected by various kinds of diseases. These diseases firstly affect the leaves of the plant and later infected the whole plant which in turn affect the quality and quantity of crop cultivated. <br>
 Hence, we decided to introduce the artificial intelligence based automatic plant leaf disease detection and classification for quick and easy detection of disease and then classifying it.
<br>This approach of ours goals towards increasing the productivity of crops in agriculture. In this approach we have followed several steps i.e. image dataset collection (total of around 52,000 images), image preprocessing consists of various subsets like removing noise, converting image to hsv color space, segmentation using k-means, classification using best performing algorithm and finally developing GUI. 

### Dataset
The dataset is too large to be uploaded and we have used the datset from https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset 

### More info 
will be uploaded soon
